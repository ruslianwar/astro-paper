Hi, Iâ€™m Anwar ðŸ‘‹

I currently live in Sleman, Indonesia. I graduated from Yogyakarta Respati University, majoring in information technology. Experienced in an informal job for more than seven years as a Junior Search Engine Optimization Specialist, which focuses on creating SEO-friendly content to increase the number of visitors (organic traffic) and website ranking on the SERP (Search Engine Results Page). Skilled at rising keywords, site audits, optimizing SEO on-page, optimizing SEO off-page, and link building. In the optimization process, I utilized several SEO tools, such as Ahrefs, Semrush, Ubersuggest, MOZ, Google Analytics, and Google Search Console.
